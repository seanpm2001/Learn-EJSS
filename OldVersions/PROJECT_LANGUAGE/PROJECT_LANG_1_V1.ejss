<!-- EJSS is a mixture of JavaScript and HTML !-->
<p>Project language file 1</p>
<p>For: seanpm2001/Learn-EJSS</p>
<p>About:</p>
<p>I decided to make EJSS the main project language file for this >project (Seanpm2001/Learn-EJSS) as EJSS is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the EJSS programming language. It only makes sense to EJSS the official language for this project. It is getting its own, project language file, starting here.</p>
